Air pollution in Mexico City is a continuing concern for citizens, health experts, and environmentalists.

Located in the crater of an extinct volcano, Mexico City is about 2,240 metres above sea level. The lower atmospheric oxygen levels at this altitude cause incomplete fuel combustion in engines and higher emissions of carbon monoxide and other compounds. Intense sunlight turns these into higher than normal smog levels.

The air pollution of the Mexico City Metropolitan Area, contained within the Valley of Mexico, is measured by the Índice Metropolitano de la Calidad del Aire. Mexico City’s automatic air quality monitoring network (Red Automática de Monitoreo Atmosférico, or RAMA) has 34 automatic monitoring stations located throughout the Mexico City metropolitan area. The RAMA database contains data on all of the pollutants measured by the stations, including PM2.5 and PM10. Datasets containing hourly measurements from each station for each of the pollutants measured can be downloaded by year from the city’s Sistema de Monitoreo Atmosférico (SIMAT)

This project is intended to identify the relationship between the most serious pollutants and city's inhabitants health

To determine the effect of air pollution in Mexico City on respiratory health, patient visits for upper respiratory tract infections in public clinics data was collected and analyzed.

Historical pollution levels data was collected and analyzed as well

Visualizations were created to show pollution levels across Mexico City municipalities and respiratory diseases incidence
